      <description>About our engineering progression frameworks The engineering progression framework is a tool that helps engineers and managers:
 make development and career plans talk about what we’re looking for from engineers in a consistent way set a fair level of compensation.  The framework is a compass, not a GPS.
It&amp;rsquo;s meant to be helpful. It&amp;rsquo;s not meant to be a rating system for humans, free from edge cases.
