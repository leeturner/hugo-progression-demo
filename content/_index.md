# Hugo Progression
Hugo Progression is a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) template that can render progression frameworks using the same data format as the [Monzo progression framework](https://github.com/monzo/progression-framework)

## What Are Progression Frameworks ?

A progression framework (or ‚Äòcompetency matrix‚Äô, ‚Äòcareer ladder‚Äô, ‚Äòcareer pathway‚Äô) is a tool to help people within an organisation understand where they currently are and how to progress and grow in their work.  It also helps an organisation map people's competencies (their skills and knowledge) to compensation (how they're rewarded for them financially).

When done right, a tool like this helps employees to grow and hone their strengths, and helps managers ensure that their organisations are in good shape and their employees happy.
